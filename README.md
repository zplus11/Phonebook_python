- [x] Add multiple numbers for a friend, 
- [x] Remove a friend,
- [x] Edit number of a friend,

## How to use
To install the program, simply download `phonebook.py` in your desired directory, and run it from there.

⚠️ **To run the program, you need to have Python, and `Levenshtein`, `json` modules installed. Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the modules using `pip install <name>` command.**

⚠️ If you were using the program before notes update, then run "update" BEFORE ANYTHING so that the necessary changes can take place.
